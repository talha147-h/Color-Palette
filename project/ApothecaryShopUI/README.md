## Favicon

This project prefers a proper ICO at `/favicon.ico`. There are two supported ways to generate it:

1) Cross-platform Node.js method (recommended)

- Script: `scripts/generate-favicon.js`
- NPM script: `npm run generate:favicon`
- Library: uses `png-to-ico` to convert a PNG into a multi-size `favicon.ico`.
- Prerequisite: Node.js/npm installed. Run `npm install` in the UI folder to install dependencies.
- Usage:

```powershell
cd ApothecaryShopUI
npm install
npm run generate:favicon
```

2) ImageMagick + PowerShell method

- Script: `scripts/generate-favicon.ps1`
- NPM script: `npm run generate:favicon:magick`
- Direct PowerShell invocation: `./scripts/generate-favicon.ps1`
- Prerequisite: ImageMagick installed and `magick` available on your PATH.
- Usage:

```powershell
cd ApothecaryShopUI
npm run generate:favicon:magick
# or directly
cd scripts
./generate-favicon.ps1
```

Both methods produce a multi-size `favicon.ico` and write it to the UI root (`ApothecaryShopUI/favicon.ico`).

PowerShell execution policy note

The PowerShell script will run under your user/system execution policy. If the script is blocked by policy, run the script manually using PowerShell and follow your organization's security guidance. To run a single script (without permanently changing policy) you can invoke PowerShell and pass the script file; if you need to change policy temporarily, a common manual command is:

```powershell
# Run the script as your user (if policy permits)
./scripts/generate-favicon.ps1

# If you must change policy (requires admin to set MachinePolicy/SystemPolicy)
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

If you change execution policy, prefer `-Scope CurrentUser` and use `RemoteSigned` rather than `Unrestricted` for better security. Revert the policy after if required by your environment.
